# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, following the
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) format. Version
numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/): `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

To ship a release: move the relevant `[Unreleased]` entries under a new
`## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading, commit, then

```bash
git tag vX.Y.Z
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The VPS picks up the new tag automatically within the hour (or run
`deploy/04-auto-deploy.sh` on the server to deploy it immediately) — see
`deploy/README.md`.
